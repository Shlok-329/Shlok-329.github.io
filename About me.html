<p> Hi, My name is Shlok Goyal.</p><p> I am currently in Ist year of B.Tech CSE in IIT Roorkee. I am from Hansi (Distt. Hisar), Haryana. I have one elder sister whose name is Snigdha Goyal
which is two years elder than me. She is also doing B.TECH CSE at MDU,Rohtak. She is very cute and there is a strong bond between us. I used to share my
 secrets with her more than my mother. My father's name is Sandeep Goyal. I respect him a lot. He is businessman by profession and I respect him a lot.
 Then, my Mother's name is Abhilasha Goyal. She is housewife and cooks very tasty food. I love her a lot.</p><p> I have cleared JEE Mains and JEE ADVANCED
 with a very good rank in year 2019. I took my coaching from FIITJEE Punjabi Bagh Center for the preparation of JEE Mains, Advanced and also various
 other competitive exams. I am always a enthusiast in learning how new introducing technologies work. So, that's why I decided to take Computer
 Science and for that Roorkee is the best option to get enrolled. I have very much interest in listening songs. Listening songs was also a stress
 reliever for me during JEE Preperation.</p>
