<p>I think this is the best project that can be given to a first year students as it involves basic knowledge and involves many things to learn in the
field of web development. So, I have learnt so many things by making this project like fast keyboard typing as it involves a lot of typing and also came
to know about various HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) tags and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) syntax. I have refer to many websites for learning new tags and
syntax during project making which I have mentioned in <a href="Weblinks.html">Useful weblinks</a> I think one who opt Computer Science branch must atleast gain
knowledge about web developement. Although I could not make very attractive website but yeah I tried my best and gain motivation to work in web developement
in upcoming months. So,I am very thankful to Prof. Sudip Roy for giving me this project.</p>
