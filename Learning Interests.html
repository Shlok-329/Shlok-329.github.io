Only after joining IIT Roorkee, I came to know about various fields in computer Science on which I can work upon. As I don't know much about scopes of various
fields of Computer Science, so currently I am thinking
of exploring each and every field that is available and then decide which field interests me the most and then work upon it with full dedication.
I also want to join various cultural groups of IIT Roorkee like Music club, DebSoc. I also want to learn how to play a guitar from music club. DebSoc is the debating
society of IIT Roorkee so I want to join this group for enhancing my personality. I also want to learn management skills and leadership skills.</p>
